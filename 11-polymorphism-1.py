# Polymorphism means having the same interface/attributes in different
# classes.

# Polymorphism is the characteristic of being able to assign
# a different meaning or usage in different contexts.
# A not-so-clear/clean example is, different classes can have
# the same function name.

# Here, the class Dog and Cat has the same method named 'show_affection'
# Even if they are same, both does different actions in the instance.
#
# Since the order of the lookup is
# 'instance' -> 'class' -> 'parent class', even if the
# 'class' and 'parent class' has functions with the same name,
# the instance will only pick up the first hit,
# ie.. from the 'class' and won't go to the parent class.
