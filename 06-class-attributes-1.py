# Here we define an attribute under the class `YourClass`
# as well as an attribute within the function.

# The attribute defined in the class is called `class attributes`
# and the attribute defined in the function is called `instance attributes`.


class YourClass(object):
    classy = 10

    def set_val(self):
        self.insty = 100

dd = YourClass()
dd.classy   # This will fetch the class attribute 10.
dd.set_val()
dd.insty    # This will fetch the instance attribute 100.

# Once `dd` is instantiated, we can access both the class and instance
# attributes, ie.. dd.classy and dd.insty.
